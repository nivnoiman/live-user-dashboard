# live-user-dashboard
A JavaScript application that shows current online users.

There are four user-
email: test@test.com | password: 123456789
email: test2@test.com | password: 123456789
email: test3@test.com | password: 123456789
email: test4@test.com | password: 123456789

You can login to the system using those users (email and password).

Front end - I created a factory function to create dom  elements using vanilla js for this project to show a different way to get the same outcome. Everything was built using vanilla js and modules.

Back end - Regarding the server side I built an Api and class to communicate with the file database (txt).
Unfortunately, I didn't complete the unitest for this application.

Unitest is something that's not used at my current job, therefore when I ran into a problem while building the unitest and saw that it would be time consuming to solve it, I decided to leave it like that.
